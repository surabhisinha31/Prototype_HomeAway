HomeAway


submitted by: surabhi sinha(surabhi.sinha@sjsu.edu)

Project Description
Through this project, I have designed a web application with RESTful API that simulates HomeAway website using react and redux for Frontend and node js for Backend and Kafka for message queuing.

•	The HomeAway simulator that I have built and implemented is an application that imitates basic features and services provided by the HomeAway application.


•	The application allows the owners to list their property for rent on the website which could be booked by travelers.


•	The application is used by the travelers to book any available property (including Condo, Apartments, Studio etc.) as per their location preference and time duration listed by owner.


Setup & Run
To run the application, fork and clone the repository, cd into the homeaway-backend directory, then run the following commands to setup & start the server:

$ npm install # install required libraries

$ npm start # start the backend server on port 3001

cd into the kaka_backend directory, then run the following commands to setup & start the server:

$ npm install # install required libraries

$ npm start # start the kafka

cd into the homeaway_redux_frontend directory, then run the following commands to setup & start the server:

$ npm install # install required libraries

$ npm start # start the server on port 3000

Once the server is running, you should be able to access the app at http://localhost:3000.
